TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the tests we provided you, type './run_sanity_check.sh' from your project folder.
This will copy your alu.circ and regfile.circ into the 'tests' folder and then run the tests.

To see what happened during a test, you can go to tests and open the .circ files.
These are harnesses that are modified to have testing inputs in them. 
You can tick the clock and see the outputs of your ALU, and compare them to what you would expect.

To make your own tests, type 'python make_alu_test.py' from your project folder.
This will output a .X, .Y, .S, and .out files in your 'tests' folder, as well as a <test-name>.circ file that's a copy of the ALU-harness. Open this .circ file, and right-click on each memory element and click "Load Image...", and then select the appropriate file (alternatively, go to the sidebar and click Contents to edit them).
Load your .X file into the first, your .Y file into the second, and your .S file into the 3rd.
You can now step through your test interactively and see the output.

To run your test in an automated fashion, copy the last line outputted by the make-alu-test script and paste
it into the file called tests/sanity_test_personal.py in the list called 'tests' at the bottom of the file (there is commented line where you should insert them).
You have now added your test to the staff tests! If you run "run-test-personal.sh", your test will now be run as well!
