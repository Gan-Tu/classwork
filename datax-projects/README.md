#Introduction
These are the projects completed during Spring 2017 Data-X class, taught at Berkeley under Professor Ikhlaq Sidhu.

#Academic Honesty
If you are a student from UC Berkeley taking Data-X, please DO NOT read my code before you write your own.
Please submit your own code for grading.

The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, **"Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated."** 
The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

Rather than copying my work, please ask your GSIs, TAs, lab assistants, and instructor for help. 
If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

#Software
