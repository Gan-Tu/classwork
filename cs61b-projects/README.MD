# Introduction
These are the projects completed during Fall 2016 CS61B class: Data Structures, taught at Berkeley under Professor Paul Hilfinger.
Due to class policy, the code for the programs are not disclossed. Source code is avaliable upon request.
However, you can run the program using 
```
java -jar programName.jar
```

# Academic Honesty
If you are a student from UC Berkeley taking CS61B, please DO NOT try to decrypt my program file (and even use my code for your assignment.)
Please submit your own code for grading.

The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, **"Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated."** 
The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

Rather than copying my work, please ask your GSIs, TAs, lab assistants, and instructor for help. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

I will **not** be responsible for any consequence that resulted from any act of yours that may be deemed as cheating.

# Software
To view and test out the projects/games, you need java 1.8 or above.
