# README #

This is a mini project (implemented in Java) completed during Fall 2016 CS61B class: Data Structures, taught at Berkeley under Professor Paul Hilfinger. 

The code strictly follows the class cs61b style guidelines with proper documentation at place.

Due to class policy, the code for the programs are not disclossed. Source code is avaliable upon request.

## The Puzzle ##
In the Cube puzzle, you are presented with an initially blank cube sitting on one cell of a square grid. A face of the cube has the same size as a cell of the grid. Six of the grid's cells are painted blue; the rest are blank, along with all the faces of the cube. You may roll the cube one space vertically or horizontally. Each time you do so, the face of the cube that ends up on the bottom (touching the board) trades colors with the cell it now occupies.

For example, the board might start out as in the diagram on the left and after several moves end up as depicted in the diagram on the right. As you can see, the upper-left corner square does not change color, even though the cube passes over it, because the face of the cube that touches that square is already painted.

## Academic Honesty ##
If you are a student from UC Berkeley taking CS61B, please DO NOT read my code before you write your own. Please submit your own code for grading.

The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, "Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated." The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

Rather than copying my work, please ask your GSIs, TAs, lab assistants, and instructor for help. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

## How do I get set up? ##

You only need java 1.8 or above.

### Playing the Game ###
To play the game, double click the cube.jar file.
Alternatively, you can run the program from terminal by typing:

```
java -jar cube.jar
```

## Contribution guidelines ##

The majority of the skeleton code and structure including the UI frameworks are written and provided by professor Paul N. Hilfinger and UC Berkeley staff memeber. 

I am responsible for implementing the data structure for the core cube model and the main class.
