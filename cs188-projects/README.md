# Introduction
These are the projects completed during Spring 2017 CS188 class: Artificial Intelligence, taught at UC Berkeley under Professor Anca Dragan.

In these projects, I 

- (a) built 5 core graph traversal algorithms for Pacman agents to find paths through random maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect all food pellets efficiently; 
- (b) developed Minimax/Expectimax search and engineered evaluation functions. Leveraged Markov Decision Process and Reinforcement Learning algorithms like Approximate Q-Learning to help Pacman learn and avoid ghosts; 
- (c) implemented Bayes Nets inference, Exact and Approximate inference, and Particle Filtering algorithms to allow Pacman to locate and eat invisible pellets and multiple invisible moving ghosts efficiently and accurately.
- (d) developed a classification algorithm to identify hand written digits


# Academic Honesty
If you are a student from UC Berkeley taking CS188, please DO NOT read my code before you write your own.
Please submit your own code for grading.

The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, **"Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated."** 
The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

Rather than copying my work, please ask your GSIs, TAs, lab assistants, and instructor for help. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

I will **not** be responsible for any consequence that resulted from any act of yours that may be deemed as cheating.

# Software
To view and test out the projects/games, you need python 2.7. You can get python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)
