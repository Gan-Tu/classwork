# Introduction
These are the projects completed during Fall 2017 CS186 class: Database, taught at UC Berkeley under Instructor Joe Hellerstein.

In these projects, I 

- **B+ Tree**: Implemented a persistent [B+ trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree).
- **Iterators and Join Algorithms**: Implemented iterators and different join algorithms over tables in a database, including but not limited to _Single Nested Loop Join, Page Nested Loop Join, Block Nested Loop Join, and Sort Merge Join via External Sort_.
- **Cost Estimation and Query Optimization**: Implemented a Selinger style query optimizer that finds the optimal left-deep execution plan for a SQL statement, using information about indcies and table/data statistics.
- **Lock Manager**: Implemented the logic for table-level locking (no intent locks) as well as the wait-die and wound-wait deadlock avoidance algorithms.


# Academic Honesty
If you are a student from UC Berkeley taking CS186, please DO NOT read my code before you write your own.
Please submit your own code for grading.

The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, **"Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated."** 
The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.

Rather than copying my work, please ask your GSIs, TAs, lab assistants, and instructor for help. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.

I will **not** be responsible for any consequence that resulted from any act of yours that may be deemed as cheating.

# Software
To view and test out the database, you need java 1.8 or above.
